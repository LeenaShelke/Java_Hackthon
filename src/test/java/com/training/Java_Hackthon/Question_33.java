/*Q33. A circus is designing a tower routine consisting of people standing 
 * atop one anotherâ€™s shoulders. For practical and aesthetic reasons, each person must
 *  be both shorter and lighter than the person below him or her. Given the heights and 
 *  weights of each person in the circus, write a method to compute the largest possible
 *   number of people in such a tower. EXAMPLE: Input (ht, wt): (65, 100) (70, 150) (56, 90)
 *    (75, 190) (60, 95) (68, 110) Output: The longest tower is length 6 and includes from 
 *    top to bottom: (56, 90) (60,95) (65,100) (68,110) (70,150) (75,190)
